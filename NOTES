draws from bam fits seem pretty good, except that for a few taxa (beech, gum, fir [a bit], hemlock, pine, spruce, tamarack), the boundary issues in sd of draws_logocc arise and we have crazy sd's until do the logocc truncation and that truncation is not smooth in terms of the resulting sd if the draws of occ

This does show up in sd for biomass for beech, gum, fir [a bit], hemlock, pine, spruce [a lot], tamarack.

Setting draw values > 5x the corresponding point pred for occ seems like it might make sense. Instead of the 0.001 cutoff.
Note that the se cutoff seems like it may be redundant as the pred and se track each other pretty closely at least in

Yes, 5x cutoff works well to match model-based se from bam() with sd of draws. Might also do this for PLS.

6/15/18:
at suggestion of Dave Moore, no longer excluding non-natural stands

4/14/18:
do have a number of biomass > 5k which seems unlikely
seems to be a bunch of yellow birch, red/sugar maple (weird for red maple), white/northern red oak, cottonwood

most are bigger than 60 cm and many > 80 cm

10k seems like reasonable upper limit though would really want it as fxn of dbh

Charlie suggestions - going with these in 0.4 version of fia_to_pecan

1) I'd go with Atlantic White cedar allometry.  Basically this is a subset of "other conifer" and the best Cupressaceae basis for all our cedar-juniper etc. 

 2) Use generic composite hardwood for all the hardwoods with insufficient allometries (cherries, elm, even "other hardwoods").

3) The only other tweak is that "small hardwoods" (striped maple, rose trees, little cherries, dogwood), might use a composite  of all allometries for this group.

4) hackberry definitely goes in generic hardwood.  Good screening.

CP note the available allometry is northern white cedar not atlantic

4/6/18:
if use 970,972,... for elm, max dbh is ~25 cm but we have many trees greater than that in size
that said while there are some outliners, it seems like it may not be that bad
that said, sugar maple and ash behave much more consistently in dbh-biomass relationship

cherry max dbh around 40 in allometry but there are bigger ones and fair number of outliers

Atlantic white cedar seems to behave fine so maybe ok for cedar/juniper (actually it's not atlantic, it's northern white cedar)

small tree dbhs have a lot of outliers; using small rosaceae might work
using the generic hardwood - those are much denser than small rosaceae
small tree category (i.e. small maples, hornbeams etc) are a bit bigger dbh than small rosaceae

3/3/18:
now restricting to plots with only a single condition (based on having one CONDID) and only natural stands (STDORGCD==0) and only forested (COND_STATUS_CD==1)

idea is that there is little natural grassland left so these conditions restrict to land most comparable to settlement time

2/16/18:
basal area maps look pretty heterogeneous too, so biomass heterogeneity
is probably not primarily from allometry variability

2/15/18:
to unzip NRS file with true coordinates: 7z x file.zip on Linux

2/14/18:
Mike confirms 'Bg' is w/o random effects and ok to use alloms for taxa where only 1-2 alloms present

points are last iteration's imputation

2/13/18:
using avg of 10 allom draws instead of single draw does not show appreciably different smoothness in plot-level biomass; so it seems likely that the heterogeneity is a function of number and dbh of trees in plot and not of allometric sampling

2/12/18:
bam() with default fREML fitting doesn't seem to use gamma

using #sites as weights for arithmetic avg fit on log scale probably doesn't make stat sense; use with geom avg does, but note that use of geom avg pulls down the heaviest biomass areas

will need to think about loss fxn - squared error on arith or geom scale - we probably do care about absolute errors?

there are lots of sites with ~150 but there are also nearby sites with pretty low biomass; this results in a fair amount of spatial smoothing since we are operating at the 8 km grid scale

comment in paper that there is surely a lot of spatial structure in biomass in FIA but it operates at the stand level and not the landscape level

note alloms could be correlated spatially but we have no way of dealing with that

if most allom variab is tree to tree, we'll have more plot-plot variability and more spatial smoothing; if more is spatially structured we're going to oversmooth if we don't capture that smooth variation in allometry

2/7/18:
looks like there is instability (from outliers in mu0 and mu1 and effect of tau) when using site effects in the allometry (presumably if have a lot of allometries it would be better but even for PLS we are using a small number of pecan_spcd values).

There is little data for components 2 and 3 so we should probably use component 6, which Dave thinks may be ok.

2/5/18:
Andy Finley says the sampling changed as of 1999 and hard to match before and after so we should probably only use post-1999

2/1/18:
Sean's plot_corrected has true coords (merge based on CN)

There are about 2x as many plots if use before 2000. Why are so many plots not resampled post-2000? Also in many of these cases the location is different. We are identifying unique plots (locations) by PLOT x STATECD x UNITCD x COUNTYCD.
