## Fit statistical model to smooth the raw plot biomass.
## The model in principle fits in two parts - first the proportion of points occupied by trees
## then the average biomass for occupied points (called potential biomass).
## Estimated biomass is the product of occupancy and potential.
## For total biomass, all FIA analysis done on forested plots, so occupancy is always 1.
