## Fit statistical model to smooth the raw plot density.
## The model in principle fits in two parts - first the proportion of points occupied by trees
## then the average density for occupied points (called potential density).
## Estimated density is the product of occupancy and potential.
## For total density, all FIA analysis done on forested plots, so occupancy is always 1.
