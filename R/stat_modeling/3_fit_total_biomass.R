## Fit statistical model to smooth the raw plot biomass.
## The model fits in two parts - first the proportion of points occupied by trees
## (this is much more important for the taxon-level fitting)
## then the average biomass for occupied points (called potential biomass).
## Estimated biomass is the product of occupancy and potential.
